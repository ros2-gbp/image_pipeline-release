  * radial nodes: should all sub to raw topics (#906 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/906>)
    Per findings in
    https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/388#issuecomment-1902487162
    - instead of renaming xyz_radial and xyzi_radial to image_rect, I should
    have made the xyzrgb_radial use image_raw (since these nodes use
    matrices K & D):
    * Revert the change in xyzi_radial - topic is depth/image_raw as it has
    always been
    * Revert the change in xyz_radial, although it is still changed slightly
    from the old "image_raw" -> "depth/image_raw" for consistency with the
    other nodes.
    * Update xyzrgb_radial:
    * depth_registered/image_rect -> depth/image_raw
    * rgb/image_rect_color -> rgb/image_raw
    * update launch files accordingly (and remove camera_info since it no
    longer needs to be renamed, happens automagically). Note: these launch
    files are probably epically bad since realsense doesn't output radial
    images... but we'll leave them as documentation for these nodes.
  * depth_image_proc: update launch files (#905 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/905>)
    * follow up to #900 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/900> - had not noticed these launch files at the time
    * remove camera_info topics that auto remap now
  * depth_image_proc: consistent image_transport (#900 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/900>)
    * all node support image_transport and/or depth_image_transport parameters.
    * point cloud nodes use depth_image_transport parameter for all depth inputs
    * fixes so that remapping works appropriately for image topics, even when using transports other than raw
    * fixes so that remapping works appropriately for image_transport outputs (crop/convert nodes)
    * support remapping camera_info topics
  * support rgba8 and bgra8 encodings by skipping alpha channel (#869 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/869>)

  * make remaining components lazy (#853 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/853>)

  * allow use as component or node (#852 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/852>)
    This addresses
    https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/823:
    * depth_image_proc was never implemented properly this way
    * image_proc might have once worked this way, but it appears upstream
    has changed over time and it was no longer doing the job.
    * stereo_image_proc is actually implemented correctly - I just added a
    comment

  * Updated depth_image_proc for ros2
    Instantiated template for convertDepth, added options to register, and
    changed register from a class loader to an RCLPP component.

    I also lack a setup to test the launch files fully,
