  * Fix Windows compilation in image_publisher.cpp (#1061 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/1061>)
    PR https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/pull/985 added some
    code that used M_PI, but M_PI is not defined in any standard, and
    before including cmath or math.h in Windows it is necessary to
    define _USE_MATH_DEFINES to ensure that M_PI is defined.

  * Publish using unique ptr (#1016 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/1016>)
    Prevents doing an extra copy of the data when using intra-process
    communication.
  * Finish QoS updates (#1019 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/1019>)
    This implements the remainder of #847 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/847>:
    - Make sure publishers default to system defaults (reliable)
    - Add QoS overriding where possible (some of the image_transport /
    message_filters stuff doesn't really support that)
    - Use the matching heuristic for subscribers consistently

  * [rolling] image_publisher: Fix loading of the camera info parameters on startup (#983 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/983>)
    As described in
    https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/965 camera info
    is not loaded from the file on node initialization, but only when the
    parameter is reloaded.
    This PR resolves this issue and should be straightforward to port it to
    Humble, Iron and Jazzy.
  * [rolling] image_publisher: add field of view parameter (#985 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/985>)
    Currently, the default value for focal length when no camera info is
    provided defaults to 1.0 rendering whole approximate intrinsics and
    projection matrices useless. Based on [this
    article](https://learnopencv.com/approximate-focal-length-for-webcams-and-cell-phone-cameras/),
    I propose a better approximation of the focal length based on the field
    of view of the camera.
    For most of the use cases, users will either know the field of view of
    the camera the used, or they already calibrated it ahead of time.
    If there is some documentation to fill. please let me know.
    This PR should be straightforward to port it to Humble, Iron and
    Jazzy.

  * [rolling] image_publisher: Fix image, constantly flipping when static image is published (#986 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/986>)
    Continuation of
    https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/pull/984.
    When publishing video stream from a camera, the image was flipped
    correctly. Yet for a static image, which was loaded once, the flip
    function was applied every time ImagePublisher::doWork() was called,
    resulting in the published image being flipped back and forth all the
    time.
    This PR should be straightforward to port it to Humble, Iron and
    Jazzy.

    Last bit of documentation updates - putting together a single changelog

    Removed cfg files related with ROS 1 parameters
  * ROS 2: Fixed CMake (#899 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/899>)
  * image_publisher: functional component (#861 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/861>)
    * filename now functions when using a component
    * parameter callback gets called at startup when using the component
    * cleanup a bit of the logging
    * add launch file to test component more easily
  * properly remap compressed topics (#851 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/851>)
    ## Before:
    Pushing into namespace is broken, only image_raw changes (camera_info
    and transport topics should change):
    ```
    ros2 run image_publisher image_publisher_node --ros-args -p filename:=test.png -r image_raw:=foo/image_raw
    ---
    ros2 topic list
    /camera_info
    /foo/image_raw
    /image_raw/compressed
    /image_raw/compressedDepth
    /image_raw/theora
    ```
    ## After:
    Pushing into namespace now works:
    ```
    ros2 run image_publisher image_publisher_node --ros-args -p filename:=test.png -r image_raw:=foo/image_raw
    ---
    ros2 topic list
    /foo/camera_info

    * Replacing deprecated header includes with new HPP versions.

    * Fixing headers which don't work correctly.
  * Opencv 3 compatibility (#564 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/564>)
    * Remove GTK from image_view.
    It is no longer used at all in image_view.
    * Reinstate OpenCV 3 compatibility.
    While Foxy only supports Ubuntu 20.04 (and hence OpenCV 4),
    we still strive to maintain Ubuntu 18.04 (which has OpenCV 3).
    In this case, it is trivial to keep keep image_pipeline working
    with OpenCV 3, so reintroduce compatibility with it.
    * Fixes from review.
    * One more fix.
  * Use newer 'add_on_set_parameters_callback' API (#562 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/562>)
    The old API was deprecated in Foxy and since removed in https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1199.

  * fix 'VideoCapture' undefined symbol error (#318 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/318>)
    * fix 'VideoCapture' undefined symbol error
    The following error occured when trying to run image_publisher:
    [...]/devel/lib/image_publisher/image_publisher: symbol lookup error: [...]/devel/lib//libimage_publisher.so: undefined symbol: _ZN2cv12VideoCaptureC1Ev
    Probably, changes in cv_bridge reducing the OpenCV component dependencies led to the error. See
    https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/commit/8b5bbcbc1ce65734dc600695487909e0c67c1033
    This is fixed by manually finding OpenCV with the required components and adding the dependencies to the library, not just the node.

  * explicitly cast to std::vector<double> to make gcc6 happy
    With gcc6, compiling image_publisher fails with this error:
    ```
    /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp: In member function 'virtual void image_publisher::ImagePublisherNodelet::onInit()':
    /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp:180:43: error: ambiguous overload for 'operator=' (operand types are 'sensor_msgs::CameraInfo\_<std::allocator<void> >::_D_type {aka std::vector<double>}' and 'boost::assign_detail::generic_list<int>')
    camera_info\_.D = list_of(0)(0)(0)(0)(0);
    ```
    After adding an initial explicit type cast for the assignment,
    compiling fails further with:
    ```
    | /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp: In member function 'virtual void image_publisher::ImagePublisherNodelet::onInit()':

    ```
    Various sources on the internet [1, 2, 3] point to use the
    convert_to_container method; hence, this commit follows those
    suggestions and with that image_publisher compiles with gcc6.
