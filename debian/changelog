ros-rolling-image-publisher (2.2.0-3jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Replacing deprecated header includes with new HPP versions. (#566 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/566>)
    * Replacing deprecated header includes with new HPP versions.
    * CI: Switching to official Foxy Docker container.
    * Fixing headers which don't work correctly.
  * Opencv 3 compatibility (#564 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/564>)
    * Remove GTK from image_view.
    It is no longer used at all in image_view.
    * Reinstate OpenCV 3 compatibility.
    While Foxy only supports Ubuntu 20.04 (and hence OpenCV 4),
    we still strive to maintain Ubuntu 18.04 (which has OpenCV 3).
    In this case, it is trivial to keep keep image_pipeline working
    with OpenCV 3, so reintroduce compatibility with it.
    * Fixes from review.
    * One more fix.
  * Use newer 'add_on_set_parameters_callback' API (#562 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/562>)
    The old API was deprecated in Foxy and since removed in https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1199.
  * Remove redundant install call in CMakeLists.txt (#555 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/555>)

  * fix 'VideoCapture' undefined symbol error (#318 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/318>)
    * fix 'VideoCapture' undefined symbol error
    The following error occured when trying to run image_publisher:
    [...]/devel/lib/image_publisher/image_publisher: symbol lookup error: [...]/devel/lib//libimage_publisher.so: undefined symbol: _ZN2cv12VideoCaptureC1Ev
    Probably, changes in cv_bridge reducing the OpenCV component dependencies led to the error. See
    https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/commit/8b5bbcbc1ce65734dc600695487909e0c67c1033
    This is fixed by manually finding OpenCV with the required components and adding the dependencies to the library, not just the node.
    * add image_publisher opencv 2 compatibility

ros-rolling-image-publisher (1.12.20-3jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * explicitly cast to std::vector<double> to make gcc6 happy
    With gcc6, compiling image_publisher fails with this error:
    ```
    /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp: In member function 'virtual void image_publisher::ImagePublisherNodelet::onInit()':
    /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp:180:43: error: ambiguous overload for 'operator=' (operand types are 'sensor_msgs::CameraInfo\_<std::allocator<void> >::_D_type {aka std::vector<double>}' and 'boost::assign_detail::generic_list<int>')
    camera_info\_.D = list_of(0)(0)(0)(0)(0);
    ```
    After adding an initial explicit type cast for the assignment,
    compiling fails further with:
    ```
    | /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp: In member function 'virtual void image_publisher::ImagePublisherNodelet::onInit()':
    | /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp:180:65: error: call of overloaded 'vector(boost::assign_detail::generic_list<int>&)' is ambiguous
    |      camera_info\_.D = std::vector<double> (list_of(0)(0)(0)(0)(0));
    ```
    Various sources on the internet [1, 2, 3] point to use the
    convert_to_container method; hence, this commit follows those
    suggestions and with that image_publisher compiles with gcc6.

  * address gcc6 build error
    With gcc6, compiling fails with stdlib.h: No such file or directory,
    as including '-isystem /usr/include' breaks with gcc6, cf.,
    https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70129.
