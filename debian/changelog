  * Add pytest.ini to fix warning (#584 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/584>)
    Fixes the following warning:
    Warning: The 'junit_family' default value will change to 'xunit2' in pytest 6.0.
    Add 'junit_family=xunit1' to your pytest.ini file to keep the current format in future versions of pytest and silence this warning.

  * camera_checker: Ensure cols + rows are in correct order (#319 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/319>)
    Without this commit, specifying a smaller column than row size lead to
    huge reported errors:
    ```
    $ rosrun camera_calibration cameracheck.py --size 6x7 --square 0.0495
    Linearity RMS Error: 13.545 Pixels      Reprojection RMS Error: 22.766 Pixels
    $ rosrun camera_calibration cameracheck.py --size 7x6 --square 0.0495
    Linearity RMS Error: 0.092 Pixels      Reprojection RMS Error: 0.083 Pixels
    ```
    This commit switches columns and rows around if necessary.

    Move Python approximate time synchronizer to ros_comm
  * remove all trace of cv in Python (use cv2)

    calibrator.py is now using the cv2 only API when using cv_bridge.
    The API got changed too but it seems to only be used internally.
