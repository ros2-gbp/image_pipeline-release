^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

5.0.3 (2024-07-16)
------------------

5.0.2 (2024-05-27)
------------------

5.0.1 (2024-03-26)
------------------
* DisparityNode: replace full_dp parameter with sgbm_mode (`#945 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/945>`_)
  Previously, only the SGBM and HH modes were allowed
* unified changelog, add missing image, deduplicate tutorials (`#938 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/938>`_)
  Last bit of documentation updates - putting together a single changelog
  summary for the whole release (rather than scattering among packages).
  Unified the camera_info tutorial so it isn't duplicated. Added a missing
  image from image_rotate (was on local disk, but hadn't committed it)
* migrate stereo_image_proc docs (`#928 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/928>`_)
* QoS improvements for image_proc and stereo_image_proc (`#922 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/922>`_)
  First part of `#847 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/847>`_
  * Add QoS overrides for all publishers (in the new, standard way)
  * stereo_image_proc: Default subscriber QoS to SensorDataQoS
  * Clean up some of the comments around lazy subscribers, make them more
  consistent across nodes
* Contributors: Michael Ferguson, Pablo David Aranda Rodríguez

5.0.0 (2024-01-24)
------------------
* stereo_image_proc: cleanup cmake (`#904 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/904>`_)
  This was supposed to be switched over when e-turtle rolled out. J-turtle
  ain't that late...
* stereo_image_proc: consistent image_transport (`#903 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/903>`_)
  * make image_transport work
  * make remap work as expected with image_transport
  * make subscribers lazy
* support rgba8 and bgra8 encodings by skipping alpha channel (`#869 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/869>`_)
  Related with the change in ROS 1
  https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/pull/671/files
  ---------
* allow use as component or node (`#852 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/852>`_)
  This addresses
  https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/823:
  * depth_image_proc was never implemented properly this way
  * image_proc might have once worked this way, but it appears upstream
  has changed over time and it was no longer doing the job.
  * stereo_image_proc is actually implemented correctly - I just added a
  comment
