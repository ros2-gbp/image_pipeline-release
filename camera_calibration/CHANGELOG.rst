6.0.2 (2024-07-23)
------------------

6.0.1 (2024-07-22)
------------------
* Change camera info message to lower case (`#1005 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/1005>`_)
  Change camera info message to lower case since message type had been
  change in rolling and humble.
  [](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/rolling/sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo.msg)
* Formatting calib code before refactoring (`#999 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/999>`_)
  As discussed in `#975 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/975>`_ and `#973 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/973>`_
  doing the linting first.
  using style from
  [here](https://github.com/ament/ament_lint/blob/rolling/ament_pycodestyle/ament_pycodestyle/configuration/ament_pycodestyle.ini)
* Added stereo calibration using charuco board (`#976 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/976>`_)
  From `#972 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/972>`_
  Doing this first for rolling.
  This was a TODO in the repository, opening this PR to add this feature.
  - The main issue why this wasn't possible imo is the way `mk_obj_points`
  works. I'm using the inbuilt opencv function to get the points there.
  - The other is a condition when aruco markers are detected they are
  added as good points, This is fine in case of mono but in stereo these
  have to be the same number as the object points to find matches although
  this should be possible with aruco.

6.0.0 (2024-05-27)
------------------
* fix: cv2.aruco.interpolateCornersCharuco is deprecated (`#979 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/979>`_)
  There has been API Changes in the newer releases of opencv2 (from
  4.8.0). The PR addresses this by supporting both the old and new APIs.
  updated Syntax
  ```
  charucodetector = cv2.aruco.CharucoDetector(board)
  charuco_corners, charuco_ids, marker_corners, marker_ids = charucodetector.detectBoard(image)
  ```
  before 4.8.0
  ```
  marker_corners, marker_ids, rejectedImgPoints = cv2.aruco.detectMarkers( image, dictionary)
  retval, charuco_corners, charuco_ids = cv2.aruco.interpolateCornersCharuco( marker_corners, marker_ids, image, board)
  ```
  See the changed examples in the main opencv2 repo:
  https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/f9a59f2592993d3dcc080e495f4f5e02dd8ec7ef/samples/python/calibrate.py#L110
* Update for compatibility with image_pipeline 4.1.0 (`#968 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/968>`_)
  This is a PR to fix:
  - `#966 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/966>`_
  As noted in `#966 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/966>`_, as of writing image_pipeline [4.1.0 has been
  released](https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/releases/tag/4.1.0),
  is updated on
  [index.ros.org](https://index.ros.org/p/image_geometry/github-ros-perception-vision_opencv/#rolling),
  but it has not yet been migrated to
  [packages.ros.org](http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu/dists/noble/main/binary-amd64/Packages).
  As such `camera_calibration` will also require the source of
  [image_pipeline
  4.1.0](https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/releases/tag/4.1.0)
  or higher to successfully build.
  I tested to ensure successful build with colcon build & colcon test.
  Note that colcon test has the following warning that is out of scope of
  this PR:
  ```
  =============================== warnings summary ===============================
  src/camera_calibration/calibrator.py:47
  Warning: The distutils package is deprecated and slated for removal in Python 3.12. Use setuptools or check PEP 632 for potential alternatives
  ```
  Please let me know if there are any questions, concerns, or requested
  changes.
* replace disutils with python3-semver (`#970 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/970>`_)
  Fix for
  - `#969 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/969>`_
  I added a dependency for `python3-semver` to replace version parsing
  with `disutils`.
  Please let me know if you have any questions, concerns, or additional
  requested changes.

  calibration. Plus the test was basic.
* Correct three errors that prevented the node to work properly.
* Contributors: Filippo Basso, Vincent Rabaud

1.12.13 (2015-04-06)
--------------------
* replace Queue by deque of fixed size for simplicity

-------------------
* install scripts in the local bin (they are now rosrun-able again)
  fixes `#93 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/93>`_
* fix default Constructor for OpenCV flags
  this does not change anything in practice as the flag is set by the node.
  It just fixes the test.
* Contributors: Vincent Rabaud

1.12.6 (2014-07-27)
-------------------
* make sure the GUI is started in its processing thread and fix a typo
  This fully fixes `#85 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/85>`_
* fix bad call to save an image
* have display be in its own thread
  that could be a fix for `#85 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/85>`_

* fix typo that leads to segfault
  fixes `#84 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/84>`_
* also print self.report() on calibrate ... allows to use the params without having to commit them (e.g. for extrensic calibration between to cameras not used as stereo pair)
* fixes `#76 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/76>`_
  Move Python approximate time synchronizer to ros_comm
* remove all trace of cv in Python (use cv2)
* remove deprecated file (as mentioned in its help)
* fixes `#25 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/25>`_
  This is just removing deprecated options that were around since diamondback
* fixes `#74 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/74>`_
  calibrator.py is now using the cv2 only API when using cv_bridge.
  The API got changed too but it seems to only be used internally.
